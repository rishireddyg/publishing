# To install maven follow the below steps
# first log into the linux server
# create instance --> once instance started --> click on connect --> copy the ssh link

ssh -i "key.pem" ec2-user@ec2.path.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
Once linus server starts first we need to check the java-1.8.0 , basincally to run maven services we required java-1.8.0 and above version.
to check java version --> type --> java -version
if it shows java-1.7.0 version we need to install java-1.8-0
to install java updated version we have to use list grep command as follows
# sudo yum list | grep java-1.8.0
once you pass the command we will get the list of java versions
select required version from the list type
# sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel.x86_64
once you installed java version check again the version by using java -version command , if even it is showing java-1.7.0 version then we have to change it to java-1.8.0 version
# sudo update-alternatives --config java
oce pass the command shows two versions , in that you have to select latest version by passing numbers which are displayed
then change the /opt directory
# cd /opt
// to install maven follow the below steps
